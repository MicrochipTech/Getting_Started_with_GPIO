ATmega4809 GPIO Examples
===

This repository contains examples of bare metal source code for GPIO as described in [Getting Started with GPIO](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/Appnotes/90003229A.pdf) document from Microchip.
The repository contains three MPLAB X projects. Make sure you have the necessary tools:
